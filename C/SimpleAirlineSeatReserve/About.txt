Talking about the features of this Simple system, the user has to select the seat class whether to choose Business or Economy class. Then the system displays available seats, and the user has to enter that particular seat number in order to reserve it. After reserving a seat, that particular seat won’t be available anymore for other users.

This system is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it.
